## 🏐 About Me

I'm a university student who loves solving problems and building things from scratch, whether it's a shell, a small game, or a C library. I enjoy technical challenges and like figuring things out on my own or with a team. Right now, I’m exploring new fields and looking for exciting projects to grow with.
